=======

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024):
 
- This year I am using whatever language feels appropriate for each task, or
  just the one I feel like trying out or using at each pointâ€”no rules!
- Some days I *might* use something that compiles and runs on either an
  Amiga 1200 with a TF1260 accelerator, running AmigaOS 3.2.2; or on a
  Panasonic FS-A1WSX MSX2+, running MSX-DOS/Nextor.


Languages Used
--------------

- [Lua](https://lua.org) (version 5.4).
- [Python](https://python.org) (version 3.12).
- [Swift](https://swift.org) (version 6.0.2).
- Turbo Modula-2 for CP/M, running on MSX-DOS/Nextor. Development aided
  by [NTVCM](https://github.com/davidly/ntvcm).
